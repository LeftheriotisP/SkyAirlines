## Technologies Used

This application is built using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js), along with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery for front-end functionality.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store flights, users, and tickets. MongoDB Atlas provides cloud-based access, with Node.js and Express.js handling database interactions.

- Express.js: A Node.js framework managing HTTP requests and routes, used to connect the front-end with the MongoDB database for tickets, users, and flights.

- Vue.js: A JavaScript framework used to create dynamic and reusable front-end components, including features like Dark Mode and dynamic tables for ticket history.

- Node.js: Provides the server environment and handles requests via Express.js, including email notifications and database connections.

- HTML & CSS: Define the structure and styling of pages, including responsive design for different devices.

- Bootstrap: Used for layout, styling, and prebuilt components such as cards, tables, and buttons.

- JavaScript & jQuery: Adds interactivity, handles user inputs, communicates with the server using Fetch API, and implements features like the anagram game, Dark Mode, and dynamic maps.

## User Manual
### Database
- The MongoDB database was used to store the data used by the application, as mentioned in Section 3. While an attempt was made to use the classic MongoDB, due to connection and functionality problems between the database with the application and the Node.js Server, MongoDB Atlas was used, which is a cloud version of the regular MongoDB.
- The database used is called myFirstDB and consists of 4 collections: registered users, flights, tickets and transactions. Registered users are those who have an account in the application, flights are all flights offered by the airline, tickets are all user tickets and transactions are the user's ticket purchases and billing information.
- The image below shows a user's document. Each user has as fields the unique id that is automatically generated from the database “_id”, the name “firstname”, the surname “lastname”, the access name “username”, the access password “password”, the contact phone number “tel”, the identifier “trait” that is automatically entered for each user who creates an account and takes values ​​depending on whether they are a simple user “user” or an administrator “admin” and the unique 32-digit code “uuid”, unique for each user, that is automatically generated through the “UUID” library and is automatically entered with each user registration and may have the discount code “discountCode” if they have won the anagram game.
  
![dbimg1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619f11ea-5af9-45ff-9582-812f6f744a09)


These values, except for “_id”, “trait”, “uuid” and “discountCode”, are filled in either by the user when creating an account or by the administrator when creating a user account or editing an existing user.
The following image shows the document of a flight. Each flight has as fields the unique id automatically generated by the database “_id”, the departure airport “departureAirport”, the arrival airport “arrivalAirport”, the departure country “departureCountry”, the destination country “destinationCountry”, the departure date “departureDate”, the total number of seats on the flight “totalSeats”, a table containing data for each seat on the flight “seats”, the cost of business class tickets “businessticketPrice” and the cost of economy class tickets “economyticketPrice”. All fields, except for “_id” and the “seats” table, are filled in by the application administrator when creating or editing a flight. The type of fields is shown on the right side of the image.

![dbimg2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acfb4a8b-37b4-4cbc-8f1a-5274e376acec)

The following image shows the content of the “seats” table of the same record in more detail. Specifically, depending on the number of seats, an array is created whose size is the total number of seats “totalSeats”. For each seat, it contains 4 fields: the seat number “seatNumber”, the seat type “seatType”, the Boolean variable “isReserved” and the unique id that is automatically generated by the database “_id”. The “seats” table as well as the fields of each seat are automatically filled in when a flight is created by the application. The seat number “seatNumber” has the value “SeatN”, where N = 1,2,3,…, totalSeats. The seat type “seatType” is “business” for the first 12 seats of each flight and “economy” for the rest. The variable “isReserved” takes the value “false” for all seats when creating a flight as all seats are empty and when a user books a seat then it takes the value “true”.

![dbimg3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f189841e-2afe-41df-94e7-d960d1b471ad)

The following image shows the document of a ticket. Each ticket has as fields the unique id automatically generated by the database “_id”, the “_id” of the user who booked the ticket “userId”, the “_id” of the flight related to the ticket “flightId”, the unique id of the transaction “uniqueTransaction” automatically generated using the UUID library and related to the transaction contained in the ticket, the traveler’s name “firstname”, the traveler’s surname “lastname”, the traveler’s date of birth “birthDate”, the traveler’s identity number “idNumber”, the ticket seat number “seatNumber”, the ticket seat type “seatClass” and the ticket cost “ticketCost”. The type of each field is shown on the right of the image.

![dbimg4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748e967c-b416-49df-a20a-354c76131866)

The fields firstname, lastname, birthDate, idNumber and seatNumber are filled in by the user when purchasing tickets. The fields seatClass and ticketCost are automatically filled in by the user's selected seat. The fields userId and flightId are automatically filled in by the user's details and the details of the flight he has selected, while the field uniqueTransactionId is automatically created, with the method mentioned, and is the same for all tickets that the user booked at the same time so that they can be grouped into one transaction.
The following image shows the document of a transaction. Each transaction has as fields the unique id automatically generated by the database _id, the unique userId of the user who made the transaction, the ticketsId which is a table with the id of each ticket included in the transaction, the total cost of the transaction totalCost, the discount code used by the user discountCode which can be empty if not used, the email of the user to whom the transaction ticket details were sent, the type of the user's credit card cardType and the 16-digit number of the user's credit card cardNumber. The type of the fields is shown on the right of the image.

![dbimg5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c1739d-ae20-4ffe-8b37-06b52ee172c1)

The _id element is automatically generated by the MongoDB database, the userId element is obtained from the application through the user's sign-in, the ticketsIds are obtained through the application according to the userId and flightId they contain, the totalCost is automatically calculated from the user's selected seats and depending on whether he has filled in a correct discount code, while there may not be a discount code discountCode. The email, cardType and cardNumber elements are filled in by the user through the application on the ticket purchase page.
The database contains several records that were used during the development of the application to test the various functions, while there are also normal records.

### Database User Manual
The connection of the Node.js server to the MongoDB myFirstDB database is made in the app.js file as shown in the code snippets below.
![dbconnection1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecec9a23-0716-4657-9254-94b4997c0334)

![dbconnection2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53930a7a-154a-4a64-ab99-6de6f5d007ab)

The excerpts are from the app.js file on line 23 which is the connection string to the cloud database generated by MongoDB Atlas and on lines 56-71 where the application connects to the database via MURL.
To display the database it is recommended to download the MongoDB Compass application. 
Specifically:
Step 1: Install the MongoDB Compass application.
Step 2: Click on the New Collection button located at the top left of the application as in the image below

![compassinstall1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822fa584-905d-471f-925c-8ba3ae2ed8e3)

Step 3: In the URI field, paste the following connection string:
mongodb+srv://student:1234@cluster0.vnybknh.mongodb.net/myFirstDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
The connection string is generated by MongoDB Atlas and can also be found in the app.js file, on line 23, in the MURL variable as mentioned earlier.
Step 4: Click the Connect button located below and to the right of the URI.
Step 5: Click on the database named “myFirstDB” from the menu on the left

![compassinstall2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b76fe6-f1ea-44c1-b3d7-19c31ec30e0b)

Step 6: Now you can see the collections of the application database and you can select a specific one to view its documents.

### Application start
Step 1: To boot the Node.js server, enter the path where the server is located through the terminal, in this case inside the “js” folder.
Step 2: The command “npm start” is written in the terminal. With this command, nodemon will start the server and its connection to the database. The connection to the database is made using the Mongoose library and MURL, as shown in the following function in the app.js file.

![appstart1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78167177-bf81-42fe-ad96-a92a9fe0b975)

Step 3: If the server is connected, you will see the messages “Your MongoDB connector is on…” and “Your server is up and running...” in the terminal, which means that the connection was successful and the server has started. If the server has booted successfully and is connected to the database, then the airline application is fully functional and you can use it both from the admin side and from the user side.

![appstart2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa42721-8bd2-4497-bf5b-5137221ea16f)

Step 4: Start from the “homepage.html” page, which is the home page of the unregistered user, by clicking on the specific file.

### Change email address
In order for the server to be able to send email to the user, an email address and the password for it are required so that emails can be sent from it. During the tests in creating the function, it was found difficult to use Gmail accounts, for this reason it is recommended to use an Outlook account. To change the sending email, lines 28 and 39 of app.js file containing the email address and line 29 containing the password must be replaced with the corresponding information of the email you want to use.

###Possible problems
If you encounter a problem when starting the application, make sure that on line 19 in the app.js file, inside the quotes, the name of the folder in which the application files are located is written, followed by “/html”. In this case, it is “SkyAirlines” as shown in the image below.

![appstart3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bfb1969-92c2-4e84-b202-68561724c460)

If there is a problem connecting, the message “Error connecting to MongoDB:” will appear, followed by the relevant problem. The application “listens” on port 3000 of localhost as shown in line 68 of the following image from the app.js file.

![appstart4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1c320b4-2d65-490f-83d3-29257841da4f)

In case of problems with starting the server, it is recommended to change this port to another one, such as 3001, as the previous port may be used by another application on your system. Also, in case of problems with starting the application, it is recommended to use the command “npm install” in the terminal of the application path, which command will search for all packages used by the application and check if they exist or install them if they are missing.

### Application termination
To terminate the application, the command Ctrl+C is given in the terminal where the message “Terminate batch job (Y/N)” will appear and to complete the termination, it is enough to write the letter Y and Enter or the command Ctrl+C again.

![intMap1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a3fefc-0271-4545-a9d6-734011868180)

#### Tickets
The Tickets page corresponds to the file “user_transaction.html” and contains the ticket purchase. Specifically, the functions of the page are:
1) Navigation of the registered user to the Home, Ticket History and Word Game pages corresponding to the files “user_homepage.html”, “user_ticketHistory.html” and “wordGame.html” via the navigation bar at the top of the page.
2) “Dark Mode” function if it has been selected from the Home page.
3) Enlarged image of the country selected by the registered user from the map on the Home page. In these images, Spain has been selected as it serves the example. If the user has not selected a country, then such an image does not appear on the page.
4) Purchase of tickets: The registered user can purchase tickets for the flight he wants. Specifically, the user selects from the Home page the destination country “Destination Country” that interests him. If he wants to change the destination country, he must select a different country from the map on the Home page of the registered user, as indicated in a message below the enlarged image. Then he must select the departure country “Departure Country” from the dropdown list with the available countries and choose from the radio buttons below the image of the country whether he wants a simple “One Way” or a return trip “Round Trip”. If the user chooses “One Way”, only one field is displayed for selecting the departure date of the flight for the transfer, while if they choose the “Round Trip” option, 2 fields are displayed for the selection of the date of the flight for the transfer and the selection of the date of the flight for the return. Then the user must select how many people “passengers” he will book tickets for from the dropdown list that allows him from 1-5 people. In this specific example we selected “Round Trip”

![tickets1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d9c5074-1134-47ff-990c-8dafcb683f9a)

When the user presses the “Show Available Flights” button, the application will search for available flights that meet the criteria the user previously selected and will display the corresponding outbound and return flights as shown below in our example. Outbound flights are called “Outbound Flights” and return flights are called “Inbound Flights”. The user can view the details of each flight and select the ones that are wishes, one of each type, by pressing the “Book This” button on the flight card. When the user clicks on a flight, all related flights are hidden. To continue, he must press the “Select seats” button. If there are no available flights, then in order to search with different parameters, the user must start the ticket purchase process again. After clicking the “Select seats” button, an image with 60 seats on the plane appears below on the same page so that he knows their numbering and below the image, a dropdown list appears with the available seats on the specific flight and the type of each seat, for each person that the user has chosen from the previous options. Next to each dropdown list there is a message indicating for which person the user is choosing a seat. Below the dropdown lists there is a field for filling in a discount code if the user has one in his possession and a field indicating the total amount of seats based on the choices made by the user. Specifically, it calculates from the charge of the seats selected, whether a return flight has been selected and whether a correct discount code has been entered, and is dynamically updated with each selection made by the user.

![tickets2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/270a2a04-8f0c-4da0-9de4-0e1a7243271d)

In our example, 2 economy seats and a return trip were selected, where one costs €120, so 4x120 = €480, and no discount code was used. To continue, the user must click the “Continue with payment” button. By clicking the button, the previous fields will be deactivated and the following fields will appear on the same page, in order: a field for filling in the email address to which he would like the tickets to be sent, radio buttons for selecting the type of credit card, 4 fields for filling in the 16-digit credit card number, where each field accepts only 4 digits, and a field that must be filled in with the random 5-digit number that appears next to the field. If the user has not filled in any field, then he cannot proceed with the purchase of the tickets, as the “Check Out” button for purchasing the tickets will be deactivated.

![tickets3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/395ad2b3-b90f-4850-afad-dee1e69f7e53)

If the user has incorrectly filled in the 5-digit security number, a relevant message will appear as shown in the image below and they will not be able to proceed with the purchase of tickets.

![tickets4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bd11dbf-5d60-4228-98a7-dbb30c21d827)

If he has completed all the fields and the 5-digit security number is correct, he can then press the “Check Out” button to purchase his tickets and have them sent to the email address he entered in the corresponding field. The ticket booking process may take a few seconds. If the tickets are booked successfully, a confirmation message will appear. To continue, he must press the OK button.

The next image shows the tickets as they have been sent to the customer's email.

![tickets5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bba59a9-e3ce-4217-b9e7-15bbd7c60145)

As can be seen in the email, the details of each ticket are listed, which are numbered, and after the tickets, the details of the first flight, which is the outward flight, and then the details of the second flight, which is the return flight.

After filling in all the fields, the user must press the “Enter passenger info” button. Then, further down on the same page, fields will appear to fill in the details of each person who wants to book a ticket, depending on how many people they selected in the previous dropdown. The details of each person are distinguished by the titles “Passenger 1”, “Passenger 2” etc. so each person has the fields “First Name”, the surname “Last Name”, the date of birth “Date of Birth” and the identification number “Identification Number”. After filling them in, the user must press the “Show Available Flights” button to proceed.

5) Log out of the application via the Sign-Out button located in the navigation bar. If the registered user wants to log out of their account, they must click the Sign Out button and then a confirmation message will appear.

#### Ticket History
The Ticket History page corresponds to the file “user_ticketHitory.html” and contains the following functions:
1) Navigation of the registered user to the Home, Tickets and Word Game pages corresponding to the files “user_homepage.html”, “user_transaction.html” and “wordGame.html” via the navigation bar at the top of the page.
2) “Dark Mode” function if it has been selected from the Home page.
3) View user transaction history. When the registered user enters the “Ticket History” page, the application searches for all transactions “transactions” that have as “UserId” the unique id of the specific user and displays them in a table format as shown in the example below. Specifically, the table shows the unique transaction ID “Transaction Id”, the details of each ticket “Ticket Info” that the transaction concerns, the total cost “Total Cost” of the transaction’s tickets, the discount code “Discount” if used, the email to which the tickets were sent, the user’s credit card type “Card Type” and the user’s 16-digit card number “Card Number”. As can be seen from the previous images, if the user has made multiple transactions, they are displayed one below the other in the table.

![tickets6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4661103-b2ca-413a-a7fa-fa33c1e4542c)

4) Log out of the application via the Sign-Out button located in the navigation bar. If the registered user wants to log out of his account, he must click the Sign Out button and then a confirmation message will appear as shown below. Here, the registered user can confirm his logout by clicking the OK button, otherwise he can cancel his logout and remain on the same page by clicking the Cancel button. In case he clicks OK, he will be transferred to the Home page of the unregistered user.
   
#### Word Game
The Word Game page corresponds to the file “wordGame.html” and contains the following functions:
1) Navigation of the registered user to the Home, Tickets and Ticket History pages corresponding to the files “user_homepage.html”, “user_transaction.html” and “user_ticketHistory.html” via the navigation bar at the top of the page.
2) “Dark Mode” function if it has been selected from the Home page as shown in the image below
3) Anagram Game: When the user enters the “Word Game” page, the application randomly selects one of the names of the available countries for which the airline operates flights and displays it to the user having changed the order of its letters as shown below.

![game1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3b132c-5c19-4374-aea1-662a543af770)

The user is asked to find the word that has been anagrammed and fill in the fields located directly below the image with the appropriate letters and check his answer by pressing the corresponding button to win a discount code. This button appears once all the fields have been filled in. Each field accepts only one letter and is in uppercase even if the user fills in lowercase letters.

All he has to do is fill in the unique user id “User ID” that he can obtain through the search and then fill in as many fields as he wants to change their value. The administrator cannot, however, edit the user’s login details, namely the login name “username” and the login password “password”.
