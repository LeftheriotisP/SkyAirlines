## Technologies Used

This application is built using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js), along with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery for front-end functionality.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store flights, users, and tickets. MongoDB Atlas provides cloud-based access, with Node.js and Express.js handling database interactions.

- Express.js: A Node.js framework managing HTTP requests and routes, used to connect the front-end with the MongoDB database for tickets, users, and flights.

- Vue.js: A JavaScript framework used to create dynamic and reusable front-end components, including features like Dark Mode and dynamic tables for ticket history.

- Node.js: Provides the server environment and handles requests via Express.js, including email notifications and database connections.

- HTML & CSS: Define the structure and styling of pages, including responsive design for different devices.

- Bootstrap: Used for layout, styling, and prebuilt components such as cards, tables, and buttons.

- JavaScript & jQuery: Adds interactivity, handles user inputs, communicates with the server using Fetch API, and implements features like the anagram game, Dark Mode, and dynamic maps.

## File Description
## User Manual
### Database
- The MongoDB database was used to store the data used by the application, as mentioned in Section 3. While an attempt was made to use the classic MongoDB, due to connection and functionality problems between the database with the application and the Node.js Server, MongoDB Atlas was used, which is a cloud version of the regular MongoDB.
- The database used is called myFirstDB and consists of 4 collections: registered users, flights, tickets and transactions. Registered users are those who have an account in the application, flights are all flights offered by the airline, tickets are all user tickets and transactions are the user's ticket purchases and billing information.
- The image below shows a user's document. Each user has as fields the unique id that is automatically generated from the database “_id”, the name “firstname”, the surname “lastname”, the access name “username”, the access password “password”, the contact phone number “tel”, the identifier “trait” that is automatically entered for each user who creates an account and takes values ​​depending on whether they are a simple user “user” or an administrator “admin” and the unique 32-digit code “uuid”, unique for each user, that is automatically generated through the “UUID” library and is automatically entered with each user registration and may have the discount code “discountCode” if they have won the anagram game.
  
![dbimg1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619f11ea-5af9-45ff-9582-812f6f744a09)


These values, except for “_id”, “trait”, “uuid” and “discountCode”, are filled in either by the user when creating an account or by the administrator when creating a user account or editing an existing user.
The following image shows the document of a flight. Each flight has as fields the unique id automatically generated by the database “_id”, the departure airport “departureAirport”, the arrival airport “arrivalAirport”, the departure country “departureCountry”, the destination country “destinationCountry”, the departure date “departureDate”, the total number of seats on the flight “totalSeats”, a table containing data for each seat on the flight “seats”, the cost of business class tickets “businessticketPrice” and the cost of economy class tickets “economyticketPrice”. All fields, except for “_id” and the “seats” table, are filled in by the application administrator when creating or editing a flight. The type of fields is shown on the right side of the image.

The following image shows the content of the “seats” table of the same record in more detail. Specifically, depending on the number of seats, an array is created whose size is the total number of seats “totalSeats”. For each seat, it contains 4 fields: the seat number “seatNumber”, the seat type “seatType”, the Boolean variable “isReserved” and the unique id that is automatically generated by the database “_id”. The “seats” table as well as the fields of each seat are automatically filled in when a flight is created by the application. The seat number “seatNumber” has the value “SeatN”, where N = 1,2,3,…, totalSeats. The seat type “seatType” is “business” for the first 12 seats of each flight and “economy” for the rest. The variable “isReserved” takes the value “false” for all seats when creating a flight as all seats are empty and when a user books a seat then it takes the value “true”.

The following image shows the document of a ticket. Each ticket has as fields the unique id automatically generated by the database “_id”, the “_id” of the user who booked the ticket “userId”, the “_id” of the flight related to the ticket “flightId”, the unique id of the transaction “uniqueTransaction” automatically generated using the UUID library and related to the transaction contained in the ticket, the traveler’s name “firstname”, the traveler’s surname “lastname”, the traveler’s date of birth “birthDate”, the traveler’s identity number “idNumber”, the ticket seat number “seatNumber”, the ticket seat type “seatClass” and the ticket cost “ticketCost”. The type of each field is shown on the right of the image.

![dbimg4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748e967c-b416-49df-a20a-354c76131866)

The fields firstname, lastname, birthDate, idNumber and seatNumber are filled in by the user when purchasing tickets. The fields seatClass and ticketCost are automatically filled in by the user's selected seat. The fields userId and flightId are automatically filled in by the user's details and the details of the flight he has selected, while the field uniqueTransactionId is automatically created, with the method mentioned, and is the same for all tickets that the user booked at the same time so that they can be grouped into one transaction.
The following image shows the document of a transaction. Each transaction has as fields the unique id automatically generated by the database _id, the unique userId of the user who made the transaction, the ticketsId which is a table with the id of each ticket included in the transaction, the total cost of the transaction totalCost, the discount code used by the user discountCode which can be empty if not used, the email of the user to whom the transaction ticket details were sent, the type of the user's credit card cardType and the 16-digit number of the user's credit card cardNumber. The type of the fields is shown on the right of the image.

![dbimg5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c1739d-ae20-4ffe-8b37-06b52ee172c1)

The _id element is automatically generated by the MongoDB database, the userId element is obtained from the application through the user's sign-in, the ticketsIds are obtained through the application according to the userId and flightId they contain, the totalCost is automatically calculated from the user's selected seats and depending on whether he has filled in a correct discount code, while there may not be a discount code discountCode. The email, cardType and cardNumber elements are filled in by the user through the application on the ticket purchase page.
The database contains several records that were used during the development of the application to test the various functions, while there are also normal records.

### Database User Manual
The connection of the Node.js server to the MongoDB myFirstDB database is made in the app.js file as shown in the code snippets below.
![dbconnection1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecec9a23-0716-4657-9254-94b4997c0334)

![dbconnection2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53930a7a-154a-4a64-ab99-6de6f5d007ab)

The excerpts are from the app.js file on line 23 which is the connection string to the cloud database generated by MongoDB Atlas and on lines 56-71 where the application connects to the database via MURL.
To display the database it is recommended to download the MongoDB Compass application. 
Specifically:
Step 1: Install the MongoDB Compass application.
Step 2: Click on the New Collection button located at the top left of the application as in the image below

![compassinstall1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822fa584-905d-471f-925c-8ba3ae2ed8e3)

Step 3: In the URI field, paste the following connection string:
mongodb+srv://student:1234@cluster0.vnybknh.mongodb.net/myFirstDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
The connection string is generated by MongoDB Atlas and can also be found in the app.js file, on line 23, in the MURL variable as mentioned earlier.
Step 4: Click the Connect button located below and to the right of the URI.
Step 5: Click on the database named “myFirstDB” from the menu on the left

![compassinstall2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b76fe6-f1ea-44c1-b3d7-19c31ec30e0b)

Step 6: Now you can see the collections of the application database and you can select a specific one to view its documents.

### Application startup
Step 1: To boot the Node.js server, enter the path where the server is located through the terminal, in this case inside the “js” folder.
Step 2: The command “npm start” is written in the terminal. With this command, nodemon will start the server and its connection to the database. The connection to the database is made using the Mongoose library and MURL, as shown in the following function in the app.js file.

![appstart1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78167177-bf81-42fe-ad96-a92a9fe0b975)

Step 3: If the server is connected, you will see the messages “Your MongoDB connector is on…” and “Your server is up and running...” in the terminal, which means that the connection was successful and the server has started. If the server has booted successfully and is connected to the database, then the airline application is fully functional and you can use it both from the admin side and from the user side.

![appstart2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa42721-8bd2-4497-bf5b-5137221ea16f)

Step 4: Start from the “homepage.html” page, which is the home page of the unregistered user, by clicking on the specific file.

### Change email address
In order for the server to be able to send email to the user, an email address and the password for it are required so that emails can be sent from it. During the tests in creating the function, it was found difficult to use Gmail accounts, for this reason it is recommended to use an Outlook account. To change the sending email, lines 28 and 39 of app.js file containing the email address and line 29 containing the password must be replaced with the corresponding information of the email you want to use.
